In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned Ô¨Åle systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web.

Although several suggestions exist on how to create a secure key-based routing protocol, a practicable approach is still unattended.

The latter is needed to store data in a safe, replicated way. We evaluate the security of our proposed extensions to the Kademlia protocol analytically and simulate the effects of multiple disjoint paths on lookup success under the influence of adversarial nodes")])]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"democratizing-content-publication-with-coral"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#democratizing-content-publication-with-coral"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" "),a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://web.archive.org/web/20181117012712/http://www.coralcdn.org/docs/coral-nsdi04.pdf",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Democratizing Content Publication with Coral"),a("OutboundLink")],1)]),e._v(" "),a("p",[a("strong",[e._v("Freedman, Michael J., Freudenthal, Eric and Mazi√®res, David")]),e._v(": "),a("em",[e._v("CoralCDN is a peer-to-peer content distribution network that allows a user to run a web site that offers high performance and meets huge demand, all for the price of a cheap broadband Internet connection.
