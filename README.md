## Silly note

- **Security problem** - This is my smart contract educational project, thus I don't consider my game is secured (gameplay perspective) because that is not my main goal here except for smart contract part which I try to avoid any possible attack. if you have any tips to help me secure my project I'll be graceful !

- **Spaghetti code** - The project was meant to be finished quickly as possible and then my project become mess the code is hard to maintain, I kept reinventing the wheel. Looks like I need some spaghetti üçù
